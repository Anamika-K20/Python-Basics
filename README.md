# Python-Basics
Python is a simple and powerful language.It supports high-level programming language with both procedure and object oriented properties and is suitable for scripting and development of various applications.The python programming language is introduced by Guido van Rossum.It contains built in libraries for data structures and GUI(Graphical User Interface).

In python,declaration of a variable does not require the specification of the data type.So,it is called a dynamic typed language.It conatains an interpreter which will read the source program line by line and convert it into machine code.

The python supports both procedural oriented and object oriented programming language.In a single python program,both these programming language features can be used.So Python programming supports the top-down approach which allows the usage of functions.It also supports bottom-up approach which allows the usage of classes and objects.
